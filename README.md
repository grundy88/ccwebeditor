# CCWebEditor

A level editor for Chip's Challenge.

<https://ccwebeditor.netlify.app/>

Includes a play mode, to be able to test levels right in the editor. 
Play mode is adapted/derived/copied from Tile World's lynx game engine.

Includes replay mode, to view public solutions when available.

Huge shout outs to:

* all level designers, some of these creations are absolute works of art
* Tile World for being open source (especially `lxlogic.c`)
* Chuck Sommerville for creating this classic in the first place
